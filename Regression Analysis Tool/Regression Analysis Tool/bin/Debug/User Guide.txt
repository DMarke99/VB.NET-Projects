~ Use ~
1) Click 'Create New Session' and import a .csv file
2) View data in the 'Data' Tab
3) Use the tools in the 'Analysis' Tab to perform analysis on the dataset
	3a) The analysis can be exported using the 'Save' button under the 'Analysis Window'
4) Graphs can be drawn in the 'Plot Regression' option under 'Manual Analysis'
	4a) Graphs can be saved using the 'Save Graph' option under 'File'
	4b) You can edit the graph settings to alter the appearance of the graph

~ Creating .csv files ~
1) open Excel
2) create a spreadsheet with the first header or first value in cell 'A1'
	2a) There must be no columns left blank otherwise the program will encounter errors
3) input the data you want to analyse
4) save as a 'CSV (Comma delimited)'

~ Tips ~
1) Columns are 1-indexed in this program (The index of the first column is 1)
2) Try to import datasets with many rows and few columns
3) Do not import datasets with identical columns or columns which are evidently related
	2a) If the program returns an error for either of multiple linear or multiplicative regression, use dependence analysis to find the problem
	2b) Once a dependence analysis has found the independent columns, create a csv file containing only those columns and the column that you want to find a relationship for
		2bi) If the column you are trying to find a relation for is one of the independent columns, select any other column from the available columns
		2bii) Do not include columns which are just one value repeated
