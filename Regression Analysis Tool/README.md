# Regression Analysis Tool

My A Level Computer Science Coursework. The Regression Analysis Tool takes data in csv form and analyses it. It uses an array of regressions and analysis tools to determine which model is the best fit to the data.  It will also return the equation of the model used to fit the data, and summary statistics related to the data, like mean and variance.

## Prerequisites

To open and run the project yon your computer you will need [Visual Studio 2012+](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/)

## Setup

First, download the [Regression Analysis Tool](https://github.com/DMarke99/VB.NET-Projects/tree/master/Regression%20Analysis%20Tool) folder.

Once downloaded, open [Regression Analysis Tool.sln](https://github.com/DMarke99/VB.NET-Projects/blob/master/Regression%20Analysis%20Tool/Regression%20Analysis%20Tool.sln).

This will open the project in Visual Studio, from which the project can be viewed and run.

Instructions for usage of the program can be found upon opening the program.

### Warning

Compiling the project on a Mac may cause some errors, since the project was coded on Windows.
